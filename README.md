# BIOS Image Parser Exploit Tool 💻

This tool is a demonstration of exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in a BIOS image parser. It is intended for educational purposes only.

## Overview ℹ️

This exploit targets a hypothetical buffer overflow vulnerability in a BIOS firmware's image parser function called `parse_image()`. The vulnerability allows attackers to craft a malicious BMP image file that triggers the buffer overflow and executes arbitrary code during the boot process.

## Usage 🚀

1. **Craft the Payload**: Write the shellcode for the desired payload (e.g., rootkit installation, payload loading, etc.) and save it in a file named `shellcode.bin`.

2. **Craft the Malicious Image File**: Craft a malicious BMP image file containing the shellcode to exploit the vulnerability.

3. **Compile and Run**: Assemble the exploit code and inject it into the BIOS image. Boot the system with the modified BIOS image to trigger the exploit.

## Exploit Steps 🛠️

1. **Craft Payload**: Write the shellcode and embed it in the exploit code.

2. **Craft Malicious Image File**: Inject the shellcode into a BMP image file.

3. **Trigger the Exploit**: Load the malicious image file into memory and exploit the vulnerability during the BIOS boot process.

## Code Structure 🧱

The code consists of the following sections:

- **Malicious Code**: Contains the shellcode to be executed during the exploit.
- **Shellcode**: Loads and executes a file (e.g., payload.exe) on system startup.
- **Main Code**: Initiates the exploit by loading the malicious image file into memory and triggering the vulnerability.
- **File Open and Read Error Handling**: Handles errors that occur during file open and read operations.

## Vulnerability Mitigation 🛡️

To mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities like this, proper input validation and bounds checking must be implemented in firmware functions, especially those dealing with untrusted data.

## Disclaimer 📝

This tool is for educational purposes only. Do not attempt to use it for malicious intent. Always seek proper authorization before conducting security testing.
